# Caffeine Crawl: Your Local Coffee Guide - An AI Generated Astro Site

This Astro site was generated by an AI assistant for AstroHost.

## Theme & Objective
Discover and share the best local coffee shops. Reviews, maps, and brewing tips for coffee lovers everywhere. Support your local baristas!
User Prompt: Build a website called 'Caffeine Crawl' dedicated to discovering and reviewing local coffee shops. The primary function is a searchable map with user-submitted reviews and ratings. The site needs an appealing, friendly design with a hand-drawn, slightly quirky aesthetic. Key sections include a main map view, individual coffee shop pages with detailed reviews and photos, a 'submit a review' form, and a brewing tips blog. Target audience: coffee enthusiasts and those seeking unique local experiences. Important: Implement user authentication to prevent spam reviews. Consider an option to filter reviews by coffee type.

## Setup & Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or yarn install, or pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:4321` (or the port Astro assigns).

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to Cloudflare Pages or other static hosts.

## Images
The articles currently use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co`. You should replace these with actual images relevant to your content.
The frontmatter of each article in `src/content/blog/` contains an `image` field:
```yaml
image:
  url: 'https://placehold.co/800x400.png' # Update this to /images/your-image.jpg after placing it in public/images
  alt: 'Descriptive alt text for your image'   # Update this
  dataAiHint: 'relevant keywords' # Describes the intended image for placeholder replacement tools
```
Place your actual images in the `public/images/` directory and update the `url` in the frontmatter to be like `/images/your-image.jpg`.

## Cloudflare Pages Compatibility
This site is configured for static output by default (`output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`), making it ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.
If SSR with Cloudflare was explicitly requested and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter is included in `astro.config.mjs` and `package.json`, follow Cloudflare's instructions for deploying Astro SSR sites.

## Customization
- Explore `src/pages/` for page structure.
- Modify layouts in `src/layouts/`.
- Add or edit components in `src/components/`.
- Blog posts are in `src/content/blog/` (MDX or Markdown).
- Site configuration is in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Dependencies are in `package.json`.
- Tailwind CSS configuration is in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- Global styles (if any beyond Tailwind) could be added in `src/styles/global.css` and imported in `BaseLayout.astro`.

Happy coding with your AI-generated Astro site!
